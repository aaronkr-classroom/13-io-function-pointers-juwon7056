 Someone like you. Someone who'll rattle the cages. I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful.

 Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread. I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men Iike this but I will not become an executioner. I'm Batman I'm not wearing hockey pads. Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them the whole thing was your idea.

 It was a dog. It was a big dog. I can't do that as Bruce Wayne... as a man. I'm flesh and blood. I can be ignored, destroyed. But as a symbol, I can be incorruptible, I can be everlasting.
